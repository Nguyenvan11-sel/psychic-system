# LAB #1 – Java Class

## <u>Exercise 1:</u>

Write a Java application that creates a Java console application to keep
records of singers and displays stored record. Follow the following
instructions to develop the application:

Create a class named Singers with the following specifications:

- 5 instance variables that would store the following singer data (Use
    recommended variable naming conventions and appropriate data type
    for each instance variable):

  - Singer’s id

  - Singer’s name

  - Singer’s address

  - Date of birth

  - Number of albums published

- Several constructors that would allow you to construct Singer object
    with no arguments, 1 argument, 2 arguments, 3 arguments, 4
    arguments, and 5 arguments.

- Create Setters and getters for all the instance variables of class
    Singer. Make sure to have several setters that would allow you to
    set the values of individual instance variables of the singer
    object. Also create one setter that would allow you to set all the
    values of the instance variables at once. Create several getters
    that would allow you to get the current individual values of each
    instance variables of the Singer object.

- Create the driver class that would create 1 Singer (singer1) object
    with the help of the no argument constructor. Display the default
    values of the instance variables of this object singer1.

- Set the values of each instance variables with the help of setters.
    Display the values.
